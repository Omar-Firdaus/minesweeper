I built a Minesweeper clone featuring three difficulty levels: Easy, Medium, and Hard, each with progressively larger board sizes.
The game follows the standard Minesweeper rules. For those unfamiliar:
The board is a grid containing hidden mines.
Clicking a cell reveals either a mine or a number.
Numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to that cell.
Revealing a mine ends the game.
The objective is to reveal all non-mine cells without triggering a mine.
